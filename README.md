-Tech specs
In this project, I have utilized the following technologies:

Next.js: I have built this application using Next.js, a powerful and efficient React framework that enables server-side rendering and provides an excellent developer experience.

TypeScript: To ensure code reliability and maintainability, TypeScript has been employed, bringing static typing and enhanced tooling to the project.

Styled-components: For a maintainable and dynamic styling solution, I have opted for styled-components, allowing for the creation of styled React components with ease.

-Core Functionalities.
This project encompasses two primary functions, which are detailed below:

Fetch Payouts: The application interacts with a Payout Endpoint to fetch payout-related data, ensuring that the latest information is displayed to users.

Search: To enhance user experience, a search functionality has been implemented, allowing users to search by either username or payouts.

Date: Displays the date of the payout.
Status: Indicates the current status of the payout.
Payouts: Displays information related to payouts.
User Name: Shows the username associated with the payout.
